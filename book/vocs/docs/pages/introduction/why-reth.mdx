# Why Reth?

Reth is more than just another Ethereum client—it's the foundation upon which the next generation of blockchain infrastructure is being built. From powering production staking environments at institutions like Coinbase to enabling cutting-edge L2 sequencers and ZK applications, Reth represents the convergence of security, performance, and extensibility that the ecosystem demands.

Every piece of crypto infrastructure will be touching Reth one way or another. Here's why the world's leading developers and institutions are choosing Reth as their node of choice.

## Production-Grade Security

Reth isn't just theoretical—it's securing real value on Ethereum mainnet today, trusted by institutions like Coinbase for production staking infrastructure.

- **Battle-tested on Mainnet**: Validated millions of blocks with zero critical security incidents
- **Institutional Trust**: Chosen by Coinbase and other leading institutions for enterprise staking
- **Superior Architecture**: Deterministic execution, advanced memory management, and comprehensive testing
- **Fine-grained Controls**: Modular security architecture for customized risk profiles

## Future Proof Performance

Reth pushes the performance frontier across every dimension, from L2 sequencers to MEV building to archive node operations.

- **L2 Sequencer Performance**: Powers Base and other production L2s with high throughput and fast block times
- **MEV & Block Building**: Exceptionally fast block construction for competitive arbitrage opportunities
- **Archive Node Excellence**: Industry-leading historical data access with intelligent caching strategies
- **Optimized Architecture**: Async-first design with reduced memory overhead and parallel execution

## Infinitely Customizable

Reth's modular architecture means you're not locked into someone else's design decisions—build exactly the chain you need.

- **Component-Based Design**: Swap out consensus, execution, mempool, or networking modules independently
- **Custom Transaction Types**: Build specialized DeFi chains, privacy networks, and unique economic models
- **Rapid Development**: Reth SDK accelerates custom blockchain development with pre-built components
- **Production Ready**: Powers custom L2s with features impossible on traditional clients

## ZK Friendly Architecture

Reth is designed from the ground up to excel in the zero-knowledge future with stateless execution and modular architecture.

- **Stateless Execution**: Execute state transitions using witness data alone, naturally compatible with ZK proof systems
- **ZKVM Integration**: Native support for SP1, RISC Zero, and other leading zero-knowledge virtual machines
- **Production ZK Applications**: Powers real-world ZK rollups and enables Type-1 zkEVMs with full Ethereum compatibility
- **Deterministic Performance**: Optimized for efficient ZK proof generation at scale without compromising speed

## Thriving Open Source Ecosystem

The most important factor in Reth's success is our vibrant open source community building the future together.

- **Global Contributors**: Hundreds of developers from leading blockchain companies, academia, and independent teams
- **Active Development**: Sustained development velocity with continuous performance optimizations and new features
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Powers infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies, DeFi protocols, and independent validators
- **Seamless Integration**: Compatible with all major development tools, monitoring systems, and operational frameworks
